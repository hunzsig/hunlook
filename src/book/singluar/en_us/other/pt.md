## Instructions for Launching the Official Battle Platform

> The online map needs to enable the japi option of the platform in the publishing background, otherwise the lua engine library cannot be called

> For example, my project is called helloworld

1、Do your work!

2、Hot update test project

```
> sl.exe run helloworld
```

3、Package test

```
> sl.exe run helloworld -b
```

4、Secondary test

```
> sl.exe run helloworld -d
```

5、Package the release version

```
> sl.exe run helloworld -r
```

6、After the project is packaged, the test will be started. At this time, there are result files in the map/test directory of your war3 root directory, such as:

> \Warcraft3\Maps\Test\WorldEditTestMap.w3x

7、Change the name of the map file, for example, your map is Juggernaut Survival Road: crazy.v1.0.w3x, you can upload the map to the official battle platform!

### CONGRATULATIONS！
