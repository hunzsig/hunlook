### Subsequent management project

```text
You should use version code history management tools (Git, Svn, etc.) to manage your development projects.
You can use third-party hosting platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, Gtiee, Bitbucket), or self built management tools (such as Gogs). At the very least, you can use the tools to build local versions locally.
No one is perfect, and no one knows when they will make mistakes. Code history allows you to view every modification, rollback versions, and backup results.

###### Warm tip: This framework has completely stopped maintenance and can be self maintained <a target="_blank" href="https://afdian.net/a/hunzsig">The cost of giving the author a cup of tea as a gift</a>

###### When using win11, especially the newer version, you sometimes encounter pop-up errors (but you can continue to play)

###### At this time, you can choose to continue playing regardless of the pop-up window, or start the terminal or IDE (when using the IDE terminal) as an administrator to solve the problem.
