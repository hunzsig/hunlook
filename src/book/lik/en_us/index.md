### Subsequent management project

```text
You should use version code history management tools (Git, Svn, etc.) to manage your development projects.
You can use third-party hosting platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, Gtiee, Bitbucket), or self built management tools (such as Gogs). At the very least, you can use the tools to build local versions locally.
No one is perfect, and no one knows when they will make mistakes. Code history allows you to view every modification, rollback versions, and backup results.

###### When using Win11, especially the newer version, you will sometimes encounter pop-up errors (but you can continue to play)

###### At this time, you can choose to continue playing without pop ups, or start the terminal or IDE (when using the IDE terminal) with the administrator to solve the problem
